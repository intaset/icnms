  <p class="body">Prof. Ille C. Gebeshuber is Professor for Experimental Physics at the Vienna University of Technology. From 2008 until 2015 she was living and working in Malaysia, at the Institute of Microengineering and Nanoelectronics of the National University. She is an experimental physicist with expertise in biomimetics, nanotechnology and tribology. During her years in the tropics she established the conceptual framework of new, safe, biomimetic approaches to materials engineering. These are now being put into reality. </p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> Towards safe biomimetic nanotechnology: Inspirations from Nature</p>
